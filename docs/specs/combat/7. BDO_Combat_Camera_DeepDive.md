# BDO-Style Combat -- Camera Combat Integration (Deep Dive)

This document explains why the camera system is NOT just a rendering
tool, but a core component of modern action combat systems (especially
BDO-style combat).

The camera strongly influences:

-   movement direction
-   attack selection
-   targeting
-   perceived responsiveness
-   combat readability

For third-person action combat, camera design and combat design are
deeply coupled.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 1. The Hidden Truth: Camera = Combat Input Context

Many developers treat camera as:

-   visual perspective only.

AAA action combat treats camera as:

👉 the reference frame for player intent.

Combat decisions are often evaluated relative to camera orientation.

Example:

Movement direction is NOT world-space direction. Movement direction is:

movementVector relative to camera forward.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 2. Directional Combat and Camera Reference

Directional attacks rely on camera alignment.

Example:

Input: - LMB pressed - Movement forward relative to camera

Result:

Forward Slash.

Without camera-relative evaluation:

-   controls feel inconsistent
-   directional attacks become unpredictable.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Implementation Concept

Compute directional input:

dot(cameraForward, movementDirection)

Classification:

-   Forward
-   Backward
-   Left
-   Right
-   Neutral

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 3. Soft Facing and Auto-Rotation

BDO-style combat rarely uses hard lock-on.

Instead it uses:

-   soft facing
-   rotation assist

During attack phases:

-   character gently rotates toward target or movement direction.

Benefits:

-   fluid control
-   natural combat flow
-   no hard snapping.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 4. Camera as Targeting Assistant

Instead of explicit targeting systems early on:

Camera center acts as targeting heuristic.

Example approach:

-   raycast from camera center
-   evaluate nearby enemies
-   choose best candidate based on angle + distance.

This creates:

-   intuitive targeting
-   minimal UI requirements.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 5. Camera Feedback During Combat

Camera is also part of impact feedback.

Possible effects:

-   micro shake on hit
-   slight forward push on heavy impact
-   small FOV pulse

Important:

Effects must be subtle.

Overuse breaks readability.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 6. Camera Constraints During Attacks

Some attacks modify camera behavior.

Examples:

-   reduced camera lag
-   tighter follow
-   temporary yaw bias toward target

Purpose:

-   increase perceived control
-   reinforce weight of action.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 7. Camera vs Target Lock (Design Philosophy)

BDO-like systems usually avoid strict lock-on.

Instead they combine:

-   free camera
-   directional input
-   soft auto-alignment.

Advantages:

-   faster combat flow
-   less restriction
-   more expressive movement.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 8. Architecture Integration

Camera provides context to CombatController:

CameraSystem → provides cameraForward vector → provides cameraRight
vector

CombatController uses:

-   directional context calculation
-   target evaluation.

Important:

Camera should NOT decide combat actions. It provides context only.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 9. Common Beginner Mistakes

❌ Treating camera as visual-only system.

❌ Implementing hard lock-on too early.

❌ Using world-space input direction.

❌ Excessive camera shake.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 10. Architecture Placement

INPUT ↓ Camera Context (direction reference) ↓ CombatController ├
ActionGraph ├ DirectionalContext ├ PhaseSystem └ CancelSystem ↓
MotionAuthority ↓ CharacterMotor ↓ Animator ↓ ImpactSystem
